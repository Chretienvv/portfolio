# Portfolio website 
This is my portfolio website. I will continue to add features to the website to make it even cooler! In the readme you can find the proces, future ideas, techniques, and what I learned during the creation of the porfolio.

## Proces
With my experience in design and frontend during my education the process was pretty clear for me. 
My approach was as follows:
1. Think about what goal the portfolio must fulfill
2. Thought about the content that needs to be in the portfolio website
3. Created an mvp and prioritized the features with MoSCoW
4. Choose the technique which I wanted to choose
5. Created a design and a styleguide in sketch.
6. Thought about the small folder structure/archticture
7. Started with setting up the html structure and content.
8. First do it ugly and make it work, then optimize it. This way I show why some choices are important to make in the beginning.
9. Adding animations and cool frontend tricks
10. To be continued.....


# Future additions/ ideas
In the future I want to make my portfolio website show my skills more with cool animations, javascript features etc. 
These are some options I possibly want to implement:
- Send drawings to my email from the website
- Build the website in different frameworks
- Create cool mouse effects, bouncy letters and a dark/light mode
- Background animations
- Awesome introduction when opening the website.
- Different hosting options.
- And much moreeeeeeee :) 
- Webcomponents
- Make a backend for the information on my portfolio


## Technique
The Techniques I used to create my portfolio website are:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

I did not use any frameworks/preprocessors on purpose, because I think the basics are more important for these kind of projects.
